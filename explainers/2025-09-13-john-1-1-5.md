limitations:
* “Logos” has multiple shades of meaning (Greek philosophy vs. Jewish wisdom/Scripture).
* Ongoing debate on the balance of Hellenistic influence vs. Hebrew Scripture in John’s Prologue.
* John 1:5’s *katalambánō* can mean “overcome” **or** “understand,” hence translation differences.
* Proverbs 8:30’s **’āmōn** is lexically debated ("master craftsman," "child," or "constantly at his side").
* Philo’s *Logos* is not identical to John’s *Logos*; the similarity is chiefly shared vocabulary, not system.

> *"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning.

The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."* - John 1:1–5 (NIV)

## ⚡ At a Glance

* Identifies Jesus as the eternal **Logos** (Word).

* Introduces the Gospel’s recurring motif of **light vs. darkness**.

| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Logos**    | God’s Word; divine self-expression and agent in creation | In Greek philosophy: rational ordering principle; in Jewish tradition: God’s word/wisdom active in creation. **Philo** develops *Logos* as God’s instrument/intermediary—**not** a co‑equal divine person. |
| **Light**    | Life, revelation, truth                                  | Contrasts with darkness; signals God’s self-revelation in the Son.                                                                                                                                         |
| **Darkness** | Sin, ignorance, unbelief; opposition to the light        | A sustained motif in John; darkness cannot finally master the light.                                                                                                                                       |

## 📌 Claims (Verifiable)

* The Greek text opens with *En archē ēn ho **Logos*** (Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος).
* “In the beginning” intentionally echoes Genesis 1:1.
* Jewish wisdom texts (e.g., Proverbs 8) portray **Wisdom beside God** at creation; the role is poetic and debated (Prov 8:30 **’āmōn**).
* Philo of Alexandria (c. 20 BCE–50 CE) uses *Logos* language for God’s creative agency/instrument.
* In John 1:5, *katalambánō* can mean **“overcome”** or **“understand,”** hence the NIV’s main line “has not overcome” with a common alternate “or understood.”

## 🤔 Interpretation (Theological)

* John identifies Jesus, the Son, as the eternal **Logos** who was **with** God and **was** God (1:1–2).
* The clause *kai theos ēn ho logos* (“and the Word was God”) is best read with a **qualitative** sense—describing the Word’s divine nature without equating the Word with the Father.
* The passage undergirds classic Christian claims about **Christ’s full divinity** and is **pivotal for later Trinitarian theology** (formal conciliar language is articulated in the 4th century).
* The Prologue’s conceptual background is debated; the prudent reading sees a **Hebrew-Scripture backbone** (Genesis/Wisdom traditions) with **Hellenistic vocabulary** in the mix.
