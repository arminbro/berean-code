# John 1:1–5 - The Word in Context

> *"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."* - John 1:1–5 (NIV)

## ⚡ Big Idea

* Jesus is the eternal Word who created everything.
* John opens his Gospel with echoes of Genesis - a new creation story centered on Christ.
* The Light of Christ shines, and darkness can't stop it.

## 🔎 What Stands Out

* *Logos* ("Word") is personal here - not just an idea, but Jesus Himself.
* Verse 5 has a neat twist: the Greek word *katalambánō* can mean both "overcome" and "understand." Darkness can't beat the light, and it doesn't get it either.
* The verbs are powerful: the light **shines** (present tense) while the darkness already **failed** (past tense).

## 📌 Facts (Checkable)

* The prologue starts with **ἐν ἀρχῇ** ("In the beginning"), a clear echo of Genesis 1:1.
* The phrase **καὶ Θεὸς ἦν ὁ Λόγος** has "God" without the article, describing the Word's divine nature, not a second lesser god.
* "Through him" (δι' αὐτοῦ) in verse 3 means Jesus is the agent of creation - and the scope is universal: "all things."
* A punctuation difference in early manuscripts makes verse 4 start either "In him was life" or end verse 3 that way. Meaning isn't lost either way.

## 🤔 Christian Perspectives

* Most Christians see this as a clear statement of Jesus' divinity - fully God, yet distinct from the Father.
* My reflection: John packs so much meaning here. Creation, wisdom, light, and life all pointing to Jesus. It makes me think ahead to John 14:6, when Jesus says, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."

## 🌱 Why It Matters

* Jesus isn't just a good teacher. He's the eternal Word (John 1:1–3). He’s the one who made us and gives us life.
* Darkness feels strong, but it doesn't win. The light of Christ is shining right now and forever!
* This passage gives courage and hope when life feels overwhelming.
