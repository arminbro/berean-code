# Berean Code

A collaborative Bible study project by Christian developers, inspired by Acts 17:11.

> Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true. - Acts 17:11

This repo builds a library of **explainers**: short, sourced documents that connect Scripture to history, archaeology, languages, genre, and logic.
