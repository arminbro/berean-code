# Berean Code

A collaborative **Bible study project** by Christian developers, inspired by Acts 17:11.

> *“Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.”* - Acts 17:11

This repo is a growing library of **studies**: short, approachable notes that point out the big ideas in Scripture, highlight interesting details, and share how Christians have understood these passages through the ages. The goal: help each other dig into the Bible and grow closer to Jesus.
