# Berean Code — Project Guide

Welcome to **Berean Code**! This repo is an experiment mixing **faith** and **developer culture**. Think of it like a group Bible study, but with the best parts of dev practices: version control, clear notes, and collaboration.

The name comes from Acts 17:11 - the Bereans checked the Scriptures carefully.

---

## Purpose

Berean Code exists to:

* Build a growing library of **casual, clear studies** on Bible passages.
* Draw a clear line between **facts** (language, history, sources) and **Christian perspectives** (theology, tradition, reflections).
* Create a space for **open, respectful collaboration**.
* Experiment with tools that make Scripture study more fun, and accessible.

## 📝 Study Style

Each study should be:

1. **Scripture-first** - Start with the passage in full, name the translation.
2. **Friendly & clear** - Think Bible study notes.
3. **Consistent** - Follow the [starter template](studies/_TEMPLATE.md):

   * ⚡ Big Idea - Why this passage matters.
   * 🔎 What Stands Out - Key words, themes, details.
   * 📌 Facts - The checkable stuff (language notes, parallels, dates).
   * 🤔 Christian Perspectives - How different Christians understand the passage, plus your own reflections.
   * 🌱 Why It Matters - How this points us to Jesus or shapes life.
   * 🔗 Connections - Cross-refs to other passages.
   * 📚 Want to Go Deeper? - Links to helpful resources.

## 🔍 Facts vs. Perspectives

One of our core values is separating **what’s checkable** from **what’s perspective**:

* **Facts (Checkable):** word meanings, manuscript notes, historical events, cross-references.
* **Perspectives (Interpretive):** theology, Christian tradition, and personal reflections.

That way, people from different backgrounds can learn together without confusion.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repo** and make a branch.
2. Use the [starter template](studies/_TEMPLATE.md) for new studies in `/studies`.
3. Fill out the sections, keeping facts and perspectives distinct.
4. Open a pull request. Reviewers may suggest tweaks for clarity or consistency.
5. Join **Discussions** for bigger questions or fun rabbit trails.

---

## ⚖️ Ground Rules

* **Always cite.** Whether in Facts, Perspectives, or Want to Go Deeper, note your sources.
* **Be kind.** Challenge ideas, not people.
* **Stay transparent.** Make it clear what’s established vs. what’s perspective.
* **Build up.** The point is to grow in faith, not score points.

## 🌱 What’s Next

* Tagging system for themes (#Light, #Wisdom, #Creation, etc.).
* Auto-generated cross-references.
* Static site for easy browsing (Docusaurus, MkDocs, or similar).
* Possible API integrations for original language tools.

## 📖 Inspiration

Berean Code is shaped by two streams:

* The **Berean spirit** - digging into Scripture with eagerness and care (Acts 17:11), always pointing back to Jesus and real faith.
* The **developer ethos** - building together in the open, improving things step by step, and making room for everyone to contribute.
