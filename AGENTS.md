This document explains the purpose, philosophy, and workflow of the **Berean Code** project. It is meant for both contributors and curious readers who want to understand how this repository is structured and why it exists.

## Purpose

Berean Code is a collaborative experiment at the intersection of **faith** and **developer culture**. Inspired by Acts 17:11.
This repo applies developer practices (version control, peer review, docs culture) to the study of Scripture.

Our goals are:
- To create a library of **clear, sourced explainers** of key Bible passages.
- To distinguish between **facts** (languages, history, sources) and **interpretations** (theology, doctrine, debates).
- To invite **open, charitable discussions** while keeping the explainers focused and structured.
- To build tools and automations (eventually) that make study transparent and accessible.

## 📝 Explainer Philosophy

Each explainer is:

1. **Scripture-anchored** — Starts with the passage in full, with translation edition noted.
2. **Reader-friendly** — Written in a docs-style format (tables, timelines, bullet points).
3. **Structured** — Uses consistent sections from the [starter template](explainers/_TEMPLATE.md):
   - ⚡ At a Glance — Why this passage matters.
   - 🔑 Key Concepts — Definitions, parallels, context.
   - 📌 Claims — Verifiable facts (languages, dates, parallels).
   - 🤔 Interpretation — Theological readings and debates.
   - 🧭 Historical Anchors — Timeline to ground the passage.
   - ❓ Open Questions — Areas of active discussion.
   - 🔗 Connections — Cross-references to other texts.
   - 📚 Further Reading — Scholarly works and notes.
4. **Transparent** — Each file has frontmatter with sources (primary vs. secondary) and limitations (debated issues).

## 🔍 Fact vs. Interpretation

A cornerstone of Berean Code is separating **what can be verified** from **what is interpreted**:

- **Claims (Verifiable)**: Language facts, manuscript evidence, historical events, parallels in Jewish/Greco-Roman texts.
- **Interpretation (Theological)**: Doctrinal readings, confessional stances, theological synthesis.

This makes space for contributors of different traditions to work together without erasing differences.

---

## 💬 Discussions

- Every explainer ends with an **Open Questions** section.
- These questions are meant to spark [Discussions](https://github.com/arminbro/berean-code/discussions).

## 🧑‍💻 Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork the repo** and create a branch for your changes.
2. Use the [starter template](explainers/_TEMPLATE.md) to create a new explainer in `/explainers`.
3. Fill in all sections, being clear about claims vs. interpretation.
4. Submit a pull request. Reviewers may suggest edits for clarity, consistency, or citations.
5. Join Discussions to expand on open questions or related themes.

## ⚖️ Ground Rules

- **Cite everything.** Scripture references, translations, and external sources must be noted.
- **Disagree gently.** Assume good intent, engage arguments not people.
- **Transparency first.** Mark clearly what is debated vs. what is established.
- **Edification > winning.** Contributions should help others learn and grow, not score points.

---

## 🌱 Future Directions

- Automated verse linking (cross-references generated by script).
- Tagging system for explainers (themes like Logos, Trinity, Wisdom, etc.).
- A static site build (e.g. with Docusaurus or MkDocs) for easier browsing.
- Possible integrations with Bible APIs for inline original language tools.

## 📖 Inspiration

Berean Code stands on two heritages:
- The **Berean spirit** of examining Scripture daily with eagerness.
- The **developer ethos** of collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement.

Together, these create a space where believers can explore Scripture deeply, logically, and with openness to correction.
